I implemented Reflective Shadow Maps (RSMs), a real-time rendering technique 
introduced by Carsten Dachsbacher and Marc Stamminger. RSMs approximate one-bounce indirect 
illumination, a crucial part of global illumination, by extending standard shadow maps to store 
additional per-pixel data (depth, position, normal, flux).

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Developed a Frame Buffer Object (FBO) manager to generate shadow maps with 
        extended attributes.</li>
    <li>Implemented multi-pass rendering: shadow map generation, direct lighting, 
        low-resolution indirect lighting, and full-resolution interpolation.</li>
    <li>Designed sampling patterns and jittering for improved indirect illumination quality.</li>
    <li>Used OpenGL shaders to handle light projection, transformations, 
        shadow computations, and flux calculations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Achieved realistic indirect illumination effects with RSMs, combining direct and 
        indirect light contributions.</li>
    <li>Rendered scenes at ~17 FPS with 400 samples, showing plausible global illumination.</li>
</ul>
