PuzzlePath is an AR-based puzzle game built in Unity with Vuforia, blending physical and 
digital gameplay. Players help a penguin reach a fish by arranging tiles to create the longest 
possible path to have the highest score possible. Tangible markers act as puzzle pieces, 
making it easy to rearrange mazes and encouraging collaborative play.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AR Integration</strong>: Physical tiles are recognized and visualized 
        in-game through Vuforia.</li>
    <li><strong>Pathfinding Algorithm</strong>: Calculates the shortest path in a given 
        configuration, allowing the score to be calculated.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Gameplay</strong>: Tiles have unique effects (walls, fire, water),
         requiring strategic placement.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive UI</strong>: Level and character selection, puzzle construction 
        tools, and real-time feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
Players arrange physical tiles on a grid to design a maze. Once the configuration is set, 
the penguin automatically attempts the puzzle. AR brings the scene to life, showing the penguin's 
interactions with obstacles, water, and fire tiles. The goal is to maximize path length before 
reaching the fish. The longer the path is, the higher the score.
