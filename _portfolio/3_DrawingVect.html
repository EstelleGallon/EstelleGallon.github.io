This project implements part of the algorithm from Fidelity vs. Simplicity: A Global Approach 
to Line Drawing Vectorization (Favreau et al., 2016). The goal was to automatically convert 
raster line drawings into vectorized curve networks that balance accuracy with simplicity, 
producing a vectorized image.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Developed a region-based skeletonization algorithm, more robust to noise and sketchy 
        drawings than using simple thinning.</li>
    <li>Constructed a topological graph from skeletonized drawings using node detection 
        (endpoints, junctions, sharp turns) and edge tracing.</li>
    <li>Applied adaptive BÃ©zier curve fitting with recursive splitting to achieve high fidelity 
        to input drawings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Achieved high-fidelity curve networks from raster input.</li>
    <li>Region-based skeletonization outperformed thinning on noisy/sketchy drawings.</li>
    <li>Outputs tended to create extra short curves, suggesting hypergraph optimization could 
        simplify results.</li>
</ul>
