This project involved the design and development of "PvPétanque," a digital adaptation of 
the classic French sport, built in Unity. The goal was to create a physically-based simulation 
that captures the strategic depth of Pétanque while taking advantage of the possibilities of a 
virtual environment to introduce new gameplay elements.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Advanced Physics Simulation</strong>: A custom "Depth" model was developed to 
        simulate realistic ball-terrain interaction on sand, including sinking, drag, and collision 
        behaviors which are not achievable with standard Unity physics.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedural Terrain Generation</strong>: Unique terrains generated 
        using Perlin noise and a custom "biome" system for varied landscapes with plateaus, 
        basins, and valleys.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Item System</strong>: A power-up system inspired by Mario Kart, featuring 
        items like Repulse, Attract, and Shockwave that use real inverse-square law physics to 
        affect ball movement.</li>
    <li><strong>Throwing & UI</strong>: A natural, two-step throw mechanic (aim with mouse, charge 
        with click) and a informative UI inspired by professional Pétanque broadcasts.</li>
</ul>
