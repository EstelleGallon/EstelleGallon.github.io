This project involved the end-to-end development of a financial management application, 
from initial user research to prototyping and a formal usability evaluation. The goal was to 
create a tool that helps users gain a clear overview of their income and expenses. The app was 
developped using Android Studio.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customizable Transaction Management</strong>: Organize income, spending, 
        and savings with fully customizable categories.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal-Oriented Budgeting</strong>: Set and track specific saving goals and
         category-specific spending limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Financial Overview</strong>: Visualize expenses by category and 
        track financial progress over time via an integrated calendar.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology & Process</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User Needs Assessment</strong>: Conducted a quantitative survey to identify core 
        features, preferred devices, and pain points with existing tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong>: Analyzed feedback on tools like Revolut, 
        Boursorama, and Notion to understand what to keep and what to avoid.</li>
    <li><strong>Iterative Prototyping & Evaluation</strong>: Built a functional prototype and 
        conducted a three-phase usability study:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unstructured Exploration</strong>: Observed natural user interaction to 
            identify intuitive features and unanticipated pain points.</li>
        <li><strong>Structured Task Completion</strong>: Quantified performance on 19 core tasks, 
            measuring error rates and efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Task Interview</strong>: Gathered qualitative feedback on task difficulty 
            and user frustration.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
